The screen bears an animate image appropriate to the surrounding area (trees and brush in a forest, sandy dunes in a desert, etc.). Thus, anything behind the screen is easily hidden from visual observation unless the viewer is within immediate distance (and even then it may be obscured, depending on the circumstances)."
2,Clamp Trap,6,1,"Usable: Metal, mouth-like clamp","When activated, this device becomes a pressure-plate trap that clamps around anything that triggers it. The device is similar to a bear trap, except that when it is fully activated, it becomes invisible. It inflicts damage equal to the cypher level, and then 1 additional point per minute until it is removed."
3,Deactivator,6,4,Wearable: Ring or bracelet\nUsable: Handheld device,The user can deactivate one device within short range.

5,Detonation (Suggestion),6,2,"Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range) or handheld projector (long range)","Explodes in a patterned flash of multicolored lights and gas in an immediate radius. For all sentient creatures in the area of effect, the difficulty of Intellect defense rolls to resist reasonably worded suggestions is increased by a number of steps equal to half the cypher level (round down). The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level."
6,Disintegration Gel,6,3,Usable: Synth tube containing gel,"When applied to a specific substance, this tube produces a fist-sized amount of gel that vaporizes the material at a rate of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of material per round. The gel works for two rounds per cypher level. It has no effect on other materials. Roll for the material affected:\n```1–35 | Metal\n6–39 | A specific metal (GM’s choice)\n0–71 | Stone\n2–81 | Metal or stone\n2–98 | Synth\n9–00 | Organic matter (inflicts cypher level in damage to a living creature)```"
7,Distance Activator,6,1,"Usable: Handheld device with a small, detachable nodule","When the nodule of this device is detached and connected to any other cypher, the user of the distance activator can activate that cypher from a range of up to 1 mile (1.6 km)."
8,Duplicator (Occultic),6,1,"Form: A synth cylinder with fine, glowing lines etched across it","After one end is touched against a creature, a mass of gelatin sprays out the other end. Within three rounds, it creates what appears to be an exact, living copy of the touched creature, including clothing and equipment. But it’s a spongy façade. The copy is a level 1 creature with minimal intelligence that lasts for up to 28 hours, when it melts and evaporates away. Before that time, the copy follows simple commands, but complex thought and emotions are beyond its capabilities."
9,Ejection Nodule,6,1,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon,"For the next hour, each time the weapon the nodule is attached to strikes a solid creature or object hard enough to inflict damage (but no more than once per round), the target of the strike teleports to a random location within a radius of 100 × the cypher  Level in feet."
10,Extra Time,6,3,Wearable: Belt or ring\nUsable: Handheld device,"The user gains up to three extra rounds. After using his action to activate this device, time slows down, and he can take up to three additional actions while the rest of the world seemingly stands still. He can make attacks, move, make a recovery roll, or take any other action allowed him. Actions are resolved normally. However, this process takes a toll. For every extra action he takes, the user suffers 3 points of damage."
11,Eye In The Sky,6,0,Usable: Handheld device,"When activated, part of this device shoots 800 feet (240 m) into the air, projecting everything it sees onto a screen on the other portion of the device. The eye in the sky floats for an hour, all the while projecting what it sees."

14,Heat Sensor,6,0,"Internal: Pill or injector\nWearable: Goggles, spectacles, contact lenses\nUsable: Handheld device with a screen","For one hour, the user can perceive objects and creatures based on the heat they emit. This may allow him to see otherwise invisible or hidden targets, or even certain objects inside other objects if their temperatures are vastly different."
15,Helping Hand,6,1,"Form: A metallic, seven-fingered hand","When activated, the hand hovers near the user for 28 hours. During that time, it acts as the user’s third hand—holding objects, opening doors, turning dials, and so on. The helping hand can also make attacks as the user might, with weapons provided to it, but all such attacks are modified by two steps to the user’s detriment."
16,Hover Disk,6,1,Usable: A metal disk about 2 feet (0.6 m) across,"The user can stand upon the disk, and for ten minutes it moves as desired, up to a long distance each round. In a combat situation, the user can take an action (other than moving) and still move a long distance. Because the disk is attuned to the wearer’s thoughts, falling off is only possible if the user loses consciousness or is struck by a tremendous force (usually one that inflicts more than 8 points of damage in one blow)."
17,Image Caster,6,0,"Usable: Complex device, handheld device","Projects an ephemeral image within long range that looks real. The image looks like the user, speaks like the user, and moves as the user desires within long range for up to one hour. Physical interaction with the image shows it to be without substance."
18,Instant Wings,6,0,Wearable: Backpack,"When activated, silken wings pop out of this backpack, allowing the wearer to glide (if falling or leaping from a height) great distances, moving a long distance each round, and landing safely on the ground. The wings last until the wearer lands or for one hour, whichever comes first."
19,Magnetic Ink,6,0,Usable: Small container of ink,"When used to tattoo flesh, this ink embeds powerful magnets in the tattooed subject’s flesh. The magnet is powerful enough to hold up to 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of metal.

20,Magnetic Winch,6,3,Usable: Small metal box,"When activated, this metal box breaks into two halves joined by a very strong but thin metal cable, which is retractable and can be extended up to 120 feet (36 m). When a second switch is pressed, the boxes each become very strong magnets. When a third switch is pressed, the cable is retracted by a very powerful motor—powerful enough to pull 5000 pounds (2250 kg) of dead weight until the two boxes are joined again."
21,Mass Nodule,6,1,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to an object or creature,"If attached to an object or unresisting creature, the nodule adheres for one hour. The object or creature’s weight increases by a factor of ten, rendering most creatures unable to move, and most objects unmovable by creatures whose level (or characters whose tier) are less than the cypher level."
22,Mental Coupling,6,3,Wearable: Headband or glove\nUsable: 2-foot-long (0.6 m) synth cable,"Allows one thinking creature to speak telepathically with another, touched creature. Although the connection lasts for only one minute, vast amounts of data can be exchanged if both creatures are willing."
23,Message Capsule,6,0,Usable: A synth cylinder a foot (0.3 m) in length,"Upon activation, a message of up to a minute in length can be recited to the cylinder. When the message is complete, and the user provides a detailed description, signifying title, and/or name of the intended recipient, the cylinder fades from view. Within the next 100 hours, the cylinder appears to whomever the message was addressed, broadcasts the message, then crumbles into dust."
24,Message Detonation,6,0,Usable: A synth cylinder a foot (0.3 m) in length,"It takes an action to encode the capsule with a detailed description, signifying title, and/or name of the intended recipient. Once addressed, the cylinder fades from view. Within the next 100 hours, the cylinder appears to whomever it was addressed and explodes as a detonation in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level. Roll for the type of damage:\n```1–10 | Cell-disrupting (harms only flesh)\n1–30 | Corrosive\n1–40 | Electrical discharge\n1–50 | Heat drain (cold)\n1–75 | Fire\n6–00 | Shrapnel```"
25,Mind Control Implant,6,4,"Internal: Pill\nWearable: Disk that adheres to forehead, temporary tattoo\nUsable: Injector","This cypher consists of two devices—an injection or pill, and a control disk or temporary tattoo. They are usually found together. For ten minutes, the disk or tattoo enables long-range mental communication with—and control of—anyone who took the injection or pill. The controller can bid the target creature to do anything it could do normally."
26,Mind Sled (Occultic),6,2,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nUsable: Injector","The user falls unconscious, and a round later, a luminous crystal bloodlessly emerges from her head (the crystal is not considered a cypher). When the crystal is touched by another creature, the consciousness of the user wakes in the body of that creature (and the new creature’s consciousness is temporarily submerged). For all intents and purposes, the user is the new creature in all ways except personality. The user transfers back into her own body 28 hours later. (If the user’s body died in the meantime, there’s a chance her consciousness will remain in the host body, but most often, the user’s personality merely burns out.)"
27,Mood Patch,6,2,Wearable: Adhesive patch that activates when slapped,"The patch transfers a substance that makes the wearer feel an emotion, enter a particular state of mind, or forget something unpleasant. Roll percentile:\n```1–25 | Moods ranging from tranquil to ecstatic or one hour\n6–50 | Moods ranging from melancholy to uicidal for one hour\n1–75 | Completely truthful (01–03 on d6) or athological liar (04–06 on d6) for one hour\n6–00 | Erases one memory chosen by wearer, ermanent```"
28,Motion Activator,6,1,Usable: Small synth nodule,"When attached to another cypher or an artifact, the motion activator activates the device if anything larger than a small dog moves within immediate range. Once activated, it cannot be deactivated."
29,Muscle Cart,6,3,Usable: Small metal box with wheels,"When activated, this small cart vastly increases its mass and then begins to move forward. It can pull up to 10,000 pounds (4500 kg) for one hour, moving about 10 feet (3 m) per round regardless of terrain (within reason), but only in its original direction."
30,Nectar Dispenser,6,0,Usable: Small canister,"This device produces a delicious, thick liquid that provides nutrition and sustains up to three people for one day (or one person for three days) if there is a container to hold the nectar."
31,Needle Sphere,6,1,Usable: Metal and synth sphere,"Upon activation, the sphere floats in the air next to the user for one round per cypher level. Each round, it fires a large needle (dart) that inflicts 3 points of damage at a target designated by the user within long range. (This occurs on the user’s action, but in addition to her normal actions.) The player makes the attack rolls, and although she cannot use Effort or skill to modify her rolls, the difficulty of the attack is decreased by two steps."
32,Nevermind,6,2,"Internal: Pill, ingestible or injectable liquid\nWearable: Earring, ring, circlet","The wearer’s mind can’t be telepathically sensed or contacted for 28 hours. If the wearer has telepathic abilities or psychic attacks, they’re inaccessible. On the other hand, during this period defense rolls against all kinds of psychic and mental attacks are modified by two steps to the wearer’s benefit."
33,Orbital Launcher,6,4,Wearable: Glove of synth\nUsable: Small handheld device,"One unanchored item weighing 50 pounds (23 kg) or less within immediate range is launched upward at a chosen angle with a steady, sustained velocity that sends the object into the void over the course of several hours. If the cypher is used underground or directed to launch the item toward some sort of barrier, the cypher doesn’t activate."
34,Overwatch Defender,6,4,Usable: Sphere on a tripod,"Once activated, this device functions for 28 hours. If a creature with hostile intent comes within long range of this device, it immediately puts a force field around itself (and anything nearby) that encapsulates an immediate radius. This force field has 100 health; anyone wishing to get in or out of the field must batter their way through. It lasts until destroyed or for one hour, whichever comes first. Once the force field is down, the device is no longer active."
35,Overwatch Slayer,6,3,Usable: Sphere on a tripod,"Once activated, this device functions for 28 hours. If a creature with hostile intent comes within long range of this device, it immediately fires a blast of energy that inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. It continues to fire, once per round, for a number of rounds equivalent to the cypher level. Once it is done firing, the device is no longer active."
36,Permanent Handle,6,0,Usable: Handle-shaped metal and synth piece,"When activated, this device permanently bonds (on a molecular level) to whatever it touches, giving that object a handle. It inflicts cypher level in damage to any living creature it bonds to."

39,Ranged Protector,6,0,"Wearable: Two rings, circlets, bracelets, or belts","This cypher comes as a pair of items, but one is the master of the other. When the master item is activated, the creature wearing the other item is surrounded by a force shield that provides a bonus to Armor equal to the cypher level for ten minutes. While one character could wear both items, many use ranged protectors to put a shield around a pet, a child, or a defenseless charge who cannot normally activate a cypher. The master item can be activated from any range to surround its counterpart with the protective shield."
40,Ranged Retaliator,6,2,"Wearable: Two rings, circlets, bracelets, or belts","This cypher comes as a pair of items, but one is the master of the other. When the master item is activated, the other item pulses with electricity that inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. The master item can be activated from any range to damage the wearer of the other."
41,Reanimator,6,4,Internal: Injectable liquid\nWearable: Disk with a strap to be fastened to the head\nUsable: Metal bolt injected into the head,"If a mammal or reptile creature has not been dead for more than 28 hours, this device restores a basic semblance of life by reactivating their nervous system. The creature does not have the knowledge, skills, personality, or memories of its former self—it’s just a mindless shell that can perform basic motor functions: walk, run, or otherwise move; pick up and hold objects; make crude attacks. It obeys the verbal commands of the user. The creature operates for one hour before collapsing. Although the GM makes the final call, small creatures are typically level 1, and others are level 2."
42,Snake Eye,6,0,Usable: A synth cable 50 feet (15 m) long,The eye-like sensor on one end of this cable allows anyone holding the other end to see what it sees. Lasts for one hour.

44,Stealthy Serpent,6,2,Usable: Metal disk that is actually a tightly coiled strand,"When activated, this cypher uncoils in the form of a small, metal serpent, about 2 feet (0.6 m) long. It remains animate for one round per cypher level. It can be given a single command that must be something it can accomplish within its allotted time. Once the command is carried out, it deactivates, even if it does so before its time is up. It is a level 2 creature, but it moves with stealth as level 5. It can bite once for 2 points of damage and inject a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignoring Armor) if the victim fails a Might defense roll."
45,Still Field,6,2,"Wearable: Vest, belt, bracelet, or jumpsuit\nUsable: Handheld device","For 28 hours, the user does not register on any device that senses or tracks movement or uses sonar or similar means. A creature that relies on sonar or similar methods of sensing cannot perceive the user."
46,Targeting Oculus,6,1,Wearable: Mask with single glass lens,"When applied to a creature’s head, the mask completely envelops the head for one hour. The creature can breathe and sense normally; however, all ranged attacks the creature makes are modified by one step to the creature’s benefit."

50,X-Ray Extractor (Occultic),6,4,Usable: Glass panel with selection of dials,"When held up against a solid surface, this panel allows the user to see through up to 2 feet (0.6 m) of material. The selection of dials allows the user to discriminate between various objects within the material, permitting the visualization of buried objects, supports in walls, or organs. A successful difficulty 4 Intellect roll vaporizes a visualized discrete object, or a portion of it. An unsuccessful roll disintegrates a random chunk of material, gouging a hole in the solid surface. The device operates for one minute, and it only works if the cypher’s level is higher than the material’s level."
51,Adhesion Clamps,6,0,Wearable: Gloves\nUsable: Handles with powerful suction cups,"Allows for automatic climbing of any surface, even horizontal ones. Lasts for ten minutes per cypher level."

59,Comprehension Graft,6,1,Usable: Small metallic disk,"When applied to a creature’s head, the disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the creature can understand the words of a specific language keyed to the graft (two languages if the cypher is level 5 or higher). This is true even of creatures that do not normally have a language. If the creature could already understand the language, the cypher has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear."
60,Controlled Blinking Nodule,6,2,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to armor,"For the next 28 hours, each time the wearer of the armor the nodule is attached to is struck hard enough to inflict damage (but no more than once per round), they teleport to a spot they desire within immediate range.

154,Detonation (Horde Suppressor),6,1,Wearable: Wristband projector (long range)\nUsable: Handheld projector (long range),"Explodes to release a burst of neurotoxic mist affecting all creatures within long range, hindering all attacks for about an hour. If effectively targeted during a conflict against a ranked horde or community, the affected horde or community inflicts 1 point of damage less than normal during that community action."
155,Effort Enhancement,6,2,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nWearable: Adhesive patch that activates when slapped\nUsable: Injector","For the next 28 hours, the user can access a thin connection to the datasphere to gain a very specific effect. When applying Effort to a task related to a predetermined skill, the user can apply one free level of Effort. The skills encoded are generally restricted to the following.\n```1–10 | Melee attacks\n1–20 | Ranged attacks\n1–40 | Understanding numenera\n1–50 | Salvaging numenera\n1–60 | Crafting numenera\n1–70 | Persuasion\n1–75 | Healing\n6–80 | Speed defense\n1–85 | Intellect defense\n6–90 | Swimming\n1–95 | Riding\n6–00 | Sneaking```"
156,Emotion Smoother,6,0,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nWearable: Adhesive patch that activates when slapped\nUsable: Injector","For the next hour, the character loses access to the part of their mind that registers and produces emotion. This allows the user to experience situations they might not otherwise be able to handle, to fairly weigh options without emotional shortcuts, or to tell completely convincing lies because they are no longer generating micro-expressions or other telling responses due to emotional inconsistency."
157,Farspeaker,6,0,Usable: Handheld device,"For the next ten minutes, the user can be heard at any distant location that they can see, as long as nothing physically blocks the intervening space. They can also hear sounds made in return. The area in which the user can speak and hear is up to a short distance across in the target location."
158,Gravity Changer,6,2,Useable: Metal plates,"Once placed, the plates change the direction of gravity within an area up to a short distance in diameter. The gravitic warp could be continuous across the affected area, or it could bend and curve, changing directions within the area up to a number of times equal to the level of the cypher. Once gravity is warped, it cannot be changed and persists for 28 hours."
159,Harmony Lamp,6,0,"Useable: Crystal orb, nodule, disc","For an hour after activation, the cypher emits a combination of colored light, sound, odor, and healing nanobots that permeate an area up to a short distance across. All positive interaction tasks made in the area gain an asset. Creatures who’ve made up their minds about a topic may be open to revisiting the issue. PCs add +1 to recovery rolls made in the area."
160,Health Resonator,6,2,Usable: Bulky handheld device,"When activated, creatures within short range each gain 2 points of health (or 2 points to Might for PCs) for about an hour. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community’s or horde’s combat force, the force has +2 health during that community action."
161,Hiding Alarm Nodule,6,2,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to installation,"For the next 28 hours, each time the installation to which the nodule is attached is struck hard enough to inflict damage (but not more than once per round), the structure or installation goes out of phase for one hour. The installation must fit in a cube up to a short distance wide, tall, and deep. All contents of the out-of-phase structure also go out of phase, unless they somehow leave the structure."
162,Immobilizer,6,2,Usable: Handheld device,"The user directs one end of the cypher at a target within short range, which is then subject to an attack by a projected mass of rapidly expanding and hardening foam. The target is held immobile in the hardened mass of foam for one hour, after which the mass turns to powder."
163,Infrastructure Drill,6,1,Usable: Large sphere with a thick screw protrusion,"The user attaches this cypher to a wall or other structure. On the following round, it drills into the object and keeps going beneath the surface for the next hour, creating a series of tunnels that weaken the integrity of the structure and connecting structures. This decreases the level of all commonplace structures connected to the initial structure within long range and inflicts 3 points of damage to a ranked community’s infrastructure."
164,Installation Enhancer,6,3,Wearable: Bulky device and several metal plates,"When securely attached to an installation, it increases the level of the entire installation up to the level of the cypher for about one hour (no effect on installations of a level equal to or higher than the cypher)."
165,Installation Mover,6,2,Wearable: Bulky device and several metal plates,"When securely attached to an installation, it allows the entire installation to be moved to another location within very long range (which is normally a difficult task). The transfer requires that the user be able to push the installation to the new location, but for the duration of about an hour, the installation seems almost weightless. During the transfer, the installation does not function."
166,Instant Item,6,0,Wearable: Bulky amulet,"This cypher has a two-stage activation. The first stage occurs when the wearer keys an object that they can hold in one hand to the cypher. The object falls into a subspace pocket and remains indefinitely or until a user activates the cypher a second (and final) time, immediately retrieving the stored item."
167,Instant Wall,6,1,Usable: Handheld device,"With the addition of water and air, the small device expands into an immobile plane up to 10 feet (3 m) tall, 30 feet (9 m) long, and 2 feet (60 cm) thick. It is made from a form of shapestone and is permanent and immobile once created."
168,Instant Workshop,6,2,Usable: Handheld device,"This small device expands into a workbench that fixes itself in place. The workbench provides an adjustable-height work surface with light and a variety of attached tools suitable for working with commonplace objects, numenera objects, and structural components. The workshop enables crafting tasks by providing the appropriate tools and workspace, though it does not provide shelter from the elements. The workbench and all its components are made from a form of shapemetal, and the workbench is permanent and immobile once created"
169,Iotum Stabilizer,6,1,Usable: Bulky handheld device,"When used as part of a salvaging task, the field emitted by the cypher stabilizes all iotum within short range so that an additional 1d6 units of iotum are recovered. The additional iotum must be of the same kind that has already been discovered, and the iotum must be of a level equal to or less than the level of this cypher."
170,Iotum Upgrader,6,2,Usable: Bulky handheld device,"When attached to 1 unit of iotum, that iotum can then be used as if it were a unit of iotum 1 level higher in a crafting task. For example, an upgraded unit of io (level 1) could be used as if it were a unit of responsive synth (level 2) for the purpose of one crafting task, or a unit of quantium (level 5) could be used as if it were a unit of protomatter (level 6)."
171,Iron Wind Resistance,6,2,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nUsable: Injector","Grants the user two assets to defense tasks made to resist the effects of an instance of the iron wind (and attempts to resist any ongoing effects instigated by previous iron wind contact, if any) for the next 28 hours."
172,Mechanical Wright,6,3,Usable: Complex device,"Crafts one numenera object or structure whose level can be no higher than the mechanical wright’s level minus 3 (minimum level 1), as long as a numenera plan is provided to work from. Crafting occurs over the course of the next 28 hours, regardless of the target device’s level. Components, including parts and iotum, are contributed from the mechanical wright, which becomes completely integrated into the new numenera device over the course of the crafting process."
173,Object Replicator,6,1,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to object that weighs up to 10 pounds (5 kg),"Replicates three additional copies of most objects whose level is equal to or less than this cypher’s level. A unit of iotum can be replicated, but not functioning cyphers, artifacts, or similar devices."
174,Organ Factory,6,0,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nUsable: Injector","Over the course of 28 hours, the user grows an external, fully viable living organ or limb. This is a somewhat painful process that dazes the user for the last half of the process. The completely grown organ or limb can be transferred to another creature simply by placing it on their body and waiting a few rounds. If the recipient creature has sustained damage to the same kind of organ or limb, the newly grown one replaces it over the course of about a minute (during which time the recipient creature is stunned). Otherwise, the duplicate organ or limb withers and dies. Duplicate organs must be used within one week. All force-grown organs and limbs are sealed within a partially living, protective, translucent caul. The cypher can produce one of the following, chosen by the user at the time of the cypher’s use:\n```1–04 | Heart\n5–08 | Lung\n9–12 | Brain\n3–16 | Blood\n7–20 | Ribs\n1–25 | Eye\n6–30 | Ear\n1–35 | Hand\n6–45 | Foot\n6–55 | Full arm\n6–65 | Full leg\n6–75 | Nose\n6–85 | Mouth\n6–95 | Stomach\n6–00 | Intestines```"
175,Phasing Gloves,6,1,Wearable: Gloves,"These gloves can selectively phase through solid objects whose level is no higher than the cypher level in a fashion that allows the wearer to see what they are touching, providing an asset for anyone attempting to repair a disabled object or structure. Someone wearing the gloves could also search behind walls and under floors using the gloves. The gloves retain their phasing ability for up to one minute per cypher level. If used as part of a salvaging task, the gloves grant two assets."
176,Psychic Defense Nodule,6,2,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to side of head,"For the next 28 hours, each time the wearer of the nodule is affected by an attack that attempts to sway their actions or beliefs or that inflicts Intellect damage, they instead go into stasis for one round and remain unaffected. While in stasis, they also lose their next turn. Attacks against a wearer in stasis are made as if the wearer were protected by a force field whose level is equal to the cypher’s level."
177,Rage Thrower,6,2,Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to large tanks and a wide hose,"When activated, creatures within short range are coated with a fine mist of insinuating nano particles that enter their blood and stimulate their behavior for about an hour, making them more violent but less able to feel pain. This grants them +1 Armor but an inability to use Effort from their Intellect Pool. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community’s or horde’s combat force, the force is treated as a marauding horde during that community action."
178,Retriever,6,3,Wearable: Glove of synth and small nodule\nUsable: Small handheld device and small nodule,"These cyphers always come in at least two parts: a nodule and some kind of retrieving device. The nodule can be attached to an item your size or smaller. When the cypher is activated, that item is teleported to the device."
179,Salvage Graft,6,1,Usable: Small metallic disc,"When applied to a creature’s head, the disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the creature is trained in tasks related to salvaging numenera. If the creature is already trained or specialized in salvaging numenera, this graft has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear, but the disc remains."
180,Shapemetal,6,2,"Usable: Canister containing a silvery, shapeable clay","This metallic clay can be shaped and greatly expanded to create individual tools or objects such as a hammer, a ladder, or a basic structure such as a wall, bench, floor, staircase, and so on, as long as the total volume created could fit in a 10-foot (3 m) cube. Once formed, the structure or objects are permanent."
181,Slash-Retardant Spray,6,2,Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to large tanks and a wide hose,"For the next 28 hours, walls and structures sprayed with these repairing nanites are treated as if 1 level higher. If an hour is spent spraying down the outer walls and defense structures of a ranked community, that community gains +1 Armor during any conflict that happens over the next 28 hours."
182,Stealth Thrower,6,2,Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to large tanks and a wide hose,"When activated, creatures within short range are coated with a fine mist of dull nano particles that render them more difficult to pick out from their surroundings for about an hour, granting them an asset to stealth tasks. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community’s or horde’s combat force, the force is treated as a stealthy horde during that community action."
183,Summoning Alarm Nodule,6,2,Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to installation,"For the next 28 hours, each time the structure or installation to which the nodule is attached is struck hard enough to inflict damage (but not more than once per round), whoever attached the nodule is teleported from any location within very long range to a location standing next to the installation."
184,Sustenance Implant,6,0,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nUsable: Injector","For the next number of days equal to the cypher level, the wearer feels no ill effects from not eating or from overeating. They also gain an asset to any defense tasks to withstand poison."
185,Trail Blazer,6,0,Wearable: Single boot with attached device,"For the next 28 hours, each time the boot touches down on solid ground, it deposits a patch of nanites that mark the area with a symbol. At any time before the duration expires, the wearer (and up to one other person that can be carried along) can use an action to instantly teleport back to any of these symbols. The teleportation effect brings the cypher’s duration to an end."
186,Transdimensional Sense,6,0,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid\nUsable: Injector","The user can see out-of-phase, invisible, and transdimensional creatures, objects, and sources of energy within long range for 28 hours. If ingested by a creature who attempts to salvage a particular kind of iotum during a salvage task, the effects of this cypher grant the user one free level of Effort if they first use a level of Effort on that task."
187,Travel Bubble,6,4,Useable: Handheld device,"The user and any additional targets that can fit into a space an immediate distance in diameter are encapsulated in a spherical force field for up to ten hours or until the user collapses it. The sphere hovers at all times and moves as the user wishes vertically or horizontally up to a short distance each round. If the sphere is destroyed or collapsed, whatever it contains falls to the ground."

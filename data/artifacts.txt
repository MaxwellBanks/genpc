AMBER CASEMENT
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm) long
Effect: When activated, it solidifies the air in a 10-foot (3 m) cube of space, the center of which must be within short range of the device. The air is turned into an amberlike substance, and those trapped in it will likely suffocate or starve.
Depletion: 1–4 in 1d6

AMULET OF SAFETY
Level: 1d6
Form: Plain metallic disk on a chain
Effect: Once the amulet is keyed to a specific numenera weapon, the weapon cannot activate to harm the wearer. The amulet’s level must be at least as high as the weapon’s level.
Depletion: —

ANALYZING SHIELD
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Transparent synth shield
Effect: The bearer can see through this shield, and it has a display that analyzes the best place to strike a foe viewed through it. The bearer can use points from their Intellect Pool (rather than the more typical Might or Speed) to increase the damage of their attacks by 3 additional points per level of Effort.
Depletion: —

ARMORED FLESH
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Appears to be a collection of organic armored plates, like a carapace or very large fish scales
Effect: When placed on the wearer’s flesh, the armor grafts on permanently. It provides Armor equal to half its level (round up) but does not hinder movement or tire the wearer in any way (no Speed cost increase for applying Effort). On the contrary, the wearer’s maximum Might Pool is permanently increased by 2. However, the benefits come at a cost. Fibrous tendrils extend into the wearer’s flesh and eventually reach the spine and brain, inflicting damage in the form of 2 points of permanent maximum Intellect Pool reduction. This process takes one week. The lost points cannot be regained.
Depletion: —

AUTOMATED COOK
Level: 1d6
Form: Small metal and synth cube that has metallic arms and tools
Effect: This automaton prepares food on command. It must be given raw materials (water and organic compounds), but with those it can prepare and serve a hot, nutritious, delicious meal.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

BATTLE ARMOR
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Full suit of synth and steel armor, covering the entirety of the wearer’s body
Effect: This armor is far hardier yet somewhat lighter than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. It is heavy armor but grants an additional +2 Armor (+3 Armor if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually provides. Further, it is entirely sealed and has its own eternally renewed internal atmosphere, which completely protects against poison gases and allows the wearer to operate in an airless environment. The suit’s Armor rating also applies to damage that often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage).
Depletion: — (At any time, the GM can rule that the armor has sustained enough damage that the atmosphere and environmental protections cease, but the suit still functions as armor.)

BATTLESUIT
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Full suit of synth and steel armor, covering the entirety of the wearer’s body
Effect: This armor is far hardier yet somewhat lighter than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. It is heavy armor but grants an additional +3 to Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually offers. Further, it is entirely sealed and has its own eternally renewed internal atmosphere, which completely protects against poison gases and allows the wearer to operate in an airless environment. The suit’s Armor rating also applies to damage that often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage). In addition, the wearer gains +1 to their Might Edge and +5 to their Might Pool (+7 to their Might Pool if the artifact is level 9 or higher).
Depletion: — (At any time, the GM can rule that the armor has sustained enough damage that the atmosphere and environmental protections cease and the Might enhancements no longer function, but the suit still functions as armor.)

BOUNDING BOOTS
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Ninth World-made leather boots with small metal and synth devices worked into the sides
Effect: The boots negate gravity enough to make jumping and running easier. The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing by two steps for one of these skills if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
Depletion: —

BRAIN BUD
Level: 1d6
Form: Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of fruit. Once grafted to a host, it takes on the appearance of the host’s flesh.
Effect: The pod grafts onto any living host (must be near the brain) and injects complex chemicals that greatly improve brain activity. This increases the host’s maximum Intellect Pool by 5 (+7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
Depletion: —

CARRYALL
Level: 1d6
Form: Metallic chest with tracked wheels on either side
Effect: This device comes with a small module that can be worn on a belt. Rolling along on its wheels, the chest attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. The chest can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away (20 miles [32 km] if the artifact is level 6 or higher). The interior of the chest is mostly hollow and can hold up to 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg). The artifact must be newly activated each day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

CELLULAR DISRUPTOR
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Small handheld device with a few simple controls
Effect: This device emits a faint short-range beam that affects only organic creatures and materials. Living targets hit by the beam move one step down the damage track. Nonliving organic targets are likely destroyed. This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

CHAMELEON CLOAK
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Very thin, lightweight, transparent cloth formed into a crude cloak
Effect: When activated, the device takes on the colors and textures of everything around the wearer for ten minutes (one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher). This eases hiding and sneaking tasks by two steps.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CHIURGEON SPHERE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small, spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter
Effect: This device comes with a small module that can be worn on a belt. Floating along, the automaton attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. The sphere can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is worn by an organic creature and that creature takes damage, the automaton moves to repair the damage with cellular regenerating tools that restore 1d6 – 2 points per round (meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round). This requires no action on the part of the creature being healed. Each day, the automaton can attempt to render aid a number of times equal to its level. The artifact must be newly activated each day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

COHESION STABILIZER
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Wristband-mounted device with a few simple controls
Effect: Any attempt to affect the integrity of the wearer’s physical form by disintegrating it, encasing it, changing its phase, teleporting it, or otherwise disrupting it fails if the wearer wishes it to fail. Doing so is not an action on the wearer’s part. The artifact’s level must be equal to or higher than the effect’s level.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

CYPHER BAG
Level: 1d6
Form: Synth bag
Effect: This bag can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical handheld device. These cyphers do not count against a character’s limit.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the bag)

DIMENSIONAL ARMOR
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Full suit of synth and steel armor, covering the entirety of the wearer’s body
Effect: This armor is far hardier yet somewhat lighter than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. It is heavy armor but grants an additional +2 to Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually provides. Further, when activated, it shifts the wearer’s phase randomly for ten minutes (one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps. This shifting effect is negated by special multidimensional weapons or attacks.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (for the phase shifting ability, but after depletion, the suit still functions as armor)

DISRUPTION BLADE
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Sword or similar bladed weapon with devices affixed to the blade and hilt
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal sword (or, rarely, an axe or a cleaver). However, if the wielder uses an action to activate it, the weapon radiates a field of molecular disrupting energy for one round. During that round, if it scores a hit, it inflicts an additional 10 points of damage. If the artifact is level 6 or higher, it is an asset on the attack roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

DRILL SPEAR
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Wooden shaft with an affixed spearhead that appears to be a metallic drill
Effect: This spear functions as a normal spear. If the wielder uses it to attack a foe, upon a successful hit the wielder decides whether to activate the weapon. Upon activation, the wielder lets go of the spear and it drills into the foe, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage (5 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). However, the wielder then is no longer holding the spear. The drilling function works only in melee combat because activation occurs after the foe is struck.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

ECSTASY PARALYZER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Handheld device with a few controls
Effect: This long-range weapon fires a beam of energy that inflicts no damage. Instead, it affects the target’s mind, filling them with such pleasure that they lose their next turn. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

EXPLODING ARROW
Level: 1d6
Form: Arrow with a tiny metallic device attached to it
Effect: The arrow explodes when it strikes something, inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range.
Depletion: Automatic

FEARMAKER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: 4-foot (1 m) tall collapsible tripod with a metal cone at the top
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device, and then it takes an action to activate. When activated, the fearmaker affects the minds of all thinking creatures within long range in a 45-degree arc. Those affected are instilled with terror, making them drop what they’re holding and do one of the following:\n```01–50 | Flee for 1d6 rounds\n51–90 | Cower (losing their actions) for 1d6 rounds\n91–00 | Faint, remaining unconscious for one minute (or until roused by vigorous action)```
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

FIERY HELLMAKER
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: 7-foot (2 m) tall collapsible metal stand with a large metal disk at the top and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device, and then it takes an action to activate. When activated, the disk fires a barrage of fiery long-range missiles in all directions. Everyone and everything within long range suffers damage equal to the artifact level, unless they are within 3 feet (1 m) of the device and keep their heads down.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

FILTRATION STRAW
Level: 1d6
Form: Long, narrow synth tube
Effect: Water that passes through this tube is purified. Most liquids other than water drawn through the tube come out as water (or mostly water). It neutralizes poisons, diseases, and other contaminants up to the artifact’s level.
Depletion: —

FOOD SCANNER
Level: 1d6
Form: Handheld device with a number of controls and a wide dish at one end
Effect: When activated and pointed at food, this device sounds an alarm if the food has any contaminants or poisonous substances.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

FOOD TUBE
Level: 1d6
Form: Synth tube
Effect: The device produces a grey paste that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (two people per day if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

FORCE DOME
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: 4-foot (1 m) tall collapsible tripod with a large glass globe at the top and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device, and then it takes an action to activate. When activated, this device projects a powerful force field dome with a diameter of short range. The field is immobile, impermeable, and impenetrable until it is brought down by a force (such as a device or creature) of a higher level. Otherwise, it lasts for 28 hours, during which time it has enough air to support six humans.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

HEALING SWORD
Level: 1d6
Form: Typical sword with an odd-looking synth hilt
Effect: The broadsword blade is a Ninth World-forged addition to the numenera hilt (which likely was not a sword hilt originally). When squeezed properly, the hilt injects a healing substance into the wielder’s body, restoring 1d6 points of any stat Pool they wish (1d6 + 2 points if the artifact is level 5 or higher). If the wielder is using the sword in battle, using the healing function does not require an action.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (for the healing ability, but after depletion, it still functions as a sword)

HOOP STAFF
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Long wooden staff with a 6-inch (15 cm) bronze hoop attached to the tip. The staff is of recent creation, but the hoop is not.
Effect: Holographic images flicker to life in the hoop, warning of danger. The images are representative of the danger in some fashion. For example, approaching enemies look like threatening, amorphous creatures, and dangerous weather might look like lightning bolts coming from a cloud. At artifact level 8 and higher, the warnings come earlier and the images more accurately represent the threat. The GM decides when and how the staff warns of danger. For inexplicable reasons, sometimes it fails to deliver a warning. (Thus, it’s all right if the GM forgets about the staff occasionally.)
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

HOVER BELT
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Odd-fitting metallic mesh belt that has a metal box attachment with dial controls
Effect: The wearer can float up into the air or back down again at a rate of 20 feet (6 m) per round. Using the complex controls, the wearer can move horizontally at a much slower pace (5 feet [1.5 m] per round) in a much less stable or controlled trajectory. At artifact level 6 or higher, the wearer floats twice as fast, vertically or horizontally. The belt works for ten minutes per use.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

HOVER SQUARE
Level: 1d6
Form: Folded synth square that is 1 foot by 1 foot (30 cm by 30 cm) and unfolds into a square that is 8 feet by 8 feet (2.5 m by 2.5 m)
Effect: When unfolded and activated, this piece of synth forms a platform that moves laterally as directed by someone atop it. The platform moves up to short range in a round. It can hold up to 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg), or 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) if the artifact is level 5 or higher.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

IMAGER
Level: 1d6
Form: Small, rectangular handheld device with a clear synth panel
Effect: This device captures a perfect image of a nearby scene. It can store thousands of images, and any stored image can be shown on the synth panel. When the device is depleted, all stored images are lost.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

INSTANT BRIDGE
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Handheld device with a few controls
Effect: This device fires a cable with a powerful magnet up to long range. When the magnet strikes a metal surface, it affixes itself, and the taut cable extends into a narrow bridge about 3 feet (1 m) wide. The device can then be affixed to another metallic surface to anchor the bridge. The bridge can support 1,000 pounds (450 kg), or 2,000 pounds (900 kg) if the artifact is level 6 or higher. When deactivated, the magnets let go and the cable retracts.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

KINETIC SHIELD
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Wristband or armband with a small metallic device attached
Effect: When a physical projectile such as an arrow, a thrown knife, or a bullet-like missile comes within 4 inches (10 cm) of the wearer’s body, a powerful energy field activates automatically and attempts to slow down or deflect the projectile. The wearer’s Speed defense against such attacks is eased (eased by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the projectile still hits the wearer, the field adds 1 to Armor against the attack.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

LAUNCHER
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Metal tube with a set of winding synth tubes wrapped around it
Effect: This device launches anything about the size of a fist or smaller with great force to very long range. An inert object, such as a rock, inflicts the artifact’s level in damage. A detonation cypher (or similar explosive) can also be launched to activate on impact.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

LIGHT SPIKE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Fingerless glove of semirigid synth
Effect: When the glove is activated, a spike of solid, red-hot energy is emitted from the back of the wearer’s hand. This spike can be used as a melee weapon that inflicts damage equal to the artifact’s level. It lasts for ten minutes. If the wielder increases the spike’s power (which requires a separate action and an additional depletion roll), the damage increases by 1 point.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

LIQUID ARMOR
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Adamant silk belt with two metallic cylinders attached to it
Effect: When activated, a watery liquid sprays out of the cylinders on the belt. An electric field shapes this smart fluid, causing it to form a protective shell around the wearer, not unlike full body armor. The fluid becomes immediately (but selectively) rigid when struck, providing +3 to Armor, but it has none of the penalties associated with armor. It can be used over the top of light armor, adding to its protection, but medium or heavy armor disrupts the electric field’s shaping attempts. The liquid armor lasts for four hours (six hours if the artifact is level 8 or higher) or until deactivated.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

LIQUID SWORD
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Adamant silk wristband with a metallic cylinder attached to it
Effect: When activated, a watery liquid sprays out of the cylinder on the wristband. An electric field shapes this smart fluid, causing it to take the form of a broadsword. The fluid becomes immediately rigid and incredibly sharp, and it can be used as a normal sword that inflicts 1 additional point of damage. The sword lasts for four hours (six hours if the artifact is level 8 or higher) or until deactivated.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

LIVING ARMOR SHEATH
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: When not affixed to a creature, this looks like a mass of heavy fabric. On a creature, it looks like heavy, leathery flesh.
Effect: When worn over normal skin, this organic material adheres and conforms to the creature’s body shape. The artifact eases Might defense tasks to resist poison and disease (eases by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). Further, the wearer has +2 to Armor, but the artifact has none of the penalties associated with armor. Armor can’t be worn over the living sheath because it’s too bulky.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (checked each day while the sheath is worn)

MEPHITIC STAFF
Level: 1d6
Form: Short metal-and-glass tube fitted onto a well-made wooden quarterstaff
Effect: When activated (which is not an action), the tip of the staff releases a concentrated, immediate-range blast of noxious fumes when it is struck against a solid creature or object. An affected creature loses its next turn to coughing and choking.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

METABOLISM BUD
Level: 1d6
Form: Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of fruit. Once grafted to a host, it takes on the appearance of the host’s flesh.
Effect: The pod grafts onto any living host (usually near the brain or spine) and injects chemicals that boost the creature’s metabolism. This increases the host’s maximum Speed Pool by 5 (by 7 if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
Depletion: —

MIND IMAGER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Handheld device with a synth panel screen and wires that must be affixed to the head of a creature
Effect: This device shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking. The affected creature need not be conscious.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

MOLECULAR BONDER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Handheld device with a number of controls and a pointed end
Effect: This device fuses two objects together with a bond strength equal to its level. If flesh bonded in this way (whether to an object or to other flesh) is torn apart, it suffers damage equal to the device’s level.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

MULTIDIMENSIONAL BLADE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Short, straight bladed weapon with a large haft that has a few controls on it
Effect: When activated, the blade exists on many levels of reality at once. It inflicts damage equal to its level, and it harms creatures (such as an abykos) that can be affected only by transdimensional effects. Once activated, the blade is active for one minute.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

MURDER GLOBE
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: 3-foot (1 m) tall collapsible metal tripod with a large metal globe at the top. The globe has a number of holes in it, but it is not hollow.
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device, and then it requires an action to activate. When activated, this device does nothing for five rounds. After that, if anything larger than a mouse comes within long range of it, the globe fires a powerful projectile at that target. The projectile inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The device can attack up to ten times per round, but it never attacks the same target more than once per round. It remains on watch for 28 hours or until it has made one hundred attacks, whichever comes first.
Depletion: Automatic

NANO-NEEDLER
Level: 1d6
Form: Small handheld device with a tiny tube
Effect: This device projects a single needle—far smaller in width than a human hair—up to long range (very long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher). The needle inflicts no damage, but it can carry poison or disease, and the injection is so tiny that the victim doesn’t feel it. The needle can also penetrate (ignore) up to 4 Armor. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

NEEDLER
Level: 1d6
Form: Small handheld device with a tiny tube
Effect: This device projects a single needle (no damage), a spray of needles (1 point of damage), or a wide spray of needles (no damage, but it affects everyone within an immediate area)—user’s choice. In each case, the needles can affect anyone within long range (very long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher). The needles can be poisoned, in which case even those who don’t take damage must make Might defense rolls to avoid being poisoned. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, ignoring “rounds of ammo” costs and not requiring additional depletion rolls for using it as a rapid-fire weapon.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

NIGHTVISION GOGGLES
Level: 1d6
Form: Pair of synth goggles with dark, protruding lenses
Effect: Outside, the wearer can see at night as if it were daylight. Inside, the wearer can see in pitch darkness up to short range (long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
Depletion: —

PHASING PITON
Level: 1d6
Form: Metallic spike with a single toggle stud
Effect: When activated, the piton phases and can be inserted up to 6 inches (15 cm) into almost any material. When deactivated, the piton becomes solid again and remains embedded solidly in the material. If used as a weapon (requiring one action to activate and insert, and a second action to deactivate), the piton inflicts 6 points of damage.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

PLANT JAR
Level: 1d6
Form: Large glass or clear synth canister
Effect: A living plant placed inside this device remains alive until removed regardless of light, water, or other conditions.
Depletion: —

POISON BRAIN IMPLANT
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Capsule
Effect: When swallowed, this implant travels to the brain and nests there. Henceforth, whenever a creature establishes contact with the user’s mind (using mental attack, telepathic communication, mind control, and so on), the creature is attacked mentally. It is stunned for one round (losing its action) and takes Intellect damage equal to the artifact’s level. This effect does not prevent the contact.
Depletion: —

PSYCHIC HELMET
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Lightweight synth helmet
Effect: The wearer gains 3 Armor that protects against Intellect damage only. Further, attempts to affect the wearer’s mind are hindered (hindered by two steps if the artifact is level 7 or higher).
Depletion: —

PSYCHIC WHISTLE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Metal device 1 inch (2.5 cm) long with a single button
Effect: When the device is activated, a whistle- like sound is heard by humans within very long range. The device doesn’t actually produce sound but instead stimulates the aural center of the human brain. It has no effect on nonhumans.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

RECORDER HEADBAND
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Leather-like headband with a small device attached
Effect: This headband records everything the wearer sees as moving images that can be replayed and reviewed. It stores up to one hundred hours of images. When the device is depleted, all stored images are lost.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 per hour of use

REDLIGHT CLIP
Level: 1
Form: Metal clip or pin easily affixed to clothing
Effect: This object flashes red when in immediate range of dangerous radiation or poisonous gas.
Depletion: —

REMOTE CLAMP
Level: 1d6
Form: Metal clamp with a detachable control pad
Effect: The control pad allows someone to direct this extremely strong device to clamp and unclamp. The pad must be within very long range of the clamp to control it.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

REPAIR SPHERE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter
Effect: This device comes with a small module that can be affixed to a machine. Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the damage with sophisticated tools, requiring no additional materials, task rolls, or direction. This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal to its level. The artifact must be newly activated each day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

SAFE CORRIDOR
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Two separate metal and synth capsules about the size of a human’s head, each with a large glass plate
Effect: When the device is activated, the space between the two capsules forms an invisible corridor of breathable atmosphere with a moderate temperature. It hedges out dangerous vapors, vacuum, insects, radiation, nanites, and other particulate matter. The corridor is 8 feet (2.5 m) wide and can be up to 1 mile (1.5 km) long. It must be relatively unobstructed—uneven terrain is fine, but walls, hills, and so on will block it. The corridor remains for 28 hours.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SECOND SKIN
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: When not affixed to a creature, this looks like a mass of diaphanous fabric. On a creature, it is almost invisible.
Effect: When stretched over a creature’s normal skin, this organic material adheres and conforms to its body shape. While wearing the second skin, the creature has an asset in Might defense tasks to resist poison and disease (eased by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (checked each day while the skin is worn)

SHATTER WAND
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Broad, 8-inch (20 cm) synth stick with a single button
Effect: This weapon realigns the molecular structure of a living target, in effect crystalizing the flesh. It works at long range but has no visible manifestation (no ray or projectile). The device inflicts damage equal to its level. Further, if the target is slain by the device, the target shatters, exploding in an immediate radius with crystalline shrapnel that inflicts 3 points of damage. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SHOCK MANACLES
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Lightweight pair of metal or synth manacles
Effect: Not only are these restraints binding, but they also inflict their level in damage whenever the wearer attempts to break free. Once active, the manacles operate for 28 hours.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SKILL BUD
Level: 1d6
Form: Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of fruit. Once grafted to a host, it takes on the appearance of the host’s flesh.
Effect: This pod grafts onto any living host (must be near the brain) and injects complex chemicals that alter brain and muscle functions. This grants the host training in one (predetermined) skill, or two skills if the artifact is level 5 or higher.
Depletion: —

SKULL BLASTER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Headband with an attached cylinder that runs along the left side of the wearer’s head
Effect: This device emits a brilliant beam of focused light up to very long range. Targets hit by the beam take damage equal to the artifact’s level. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SLUGSPITTER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Long device with a narrow metal tube
Effect: With a quiet sound like a puff of air, this device fires a tiny slug of metal up to long range (very long range if the artifact is level 6 or higher). It inflicts damage equal to the artifact’s level. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100

SNIPEWAND
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Long handheld device with a tiny plate of glass
Effect: Sighting through the glass, the user can view targets up to 1 mile (1.5 km) away as if they were just a short distance away. The user must have a direct line of sight to the target—the device cannot penetrate barriers or go around corners. Once a target is sighted, the device can almost silently fire a tiny slug of metal at the target. The slug inflicts damage equal to the artifact’s level.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

STUNNER
Level: 1d6
Form: Handheld device that looks like a metal sphere with a handle
Effect: When activated, this device fires a beam of energy to short range (long range if the artifact is level 6 or higher) that stuns the target for one round, making them lose their next action. This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SUSPENSOR BELT
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Belt with a number of brass disks affixed to it
Effect: This belt negates gravity enough to make all movement easier, granting the wearer a +1 bonus to their Speed Edge. Alternatively, a grossly obese creature could wear the belt simply to function normally. The belt supports up to 300 pounds (136 kg), or 500 pounds (227 kg) if the artifact is level 6 or higher.
Depletion: —

TELLTALE GLASS
Level: 1
Form: Clear drinking glass
Effect: This glass turns red if anything poisonous is put into it, even in very small quantities.
Depletion: —

TENDRIL GRAFT
Level: 1d6
Form: Whip-like length of organic material similar to flesh
Effect: This graft attaches to the host’s spinal column so that it can be controlled like a limb. The host can use it like a whip (a light weapon) even if their hands are full. They can also use it like a prehensile tail that can hold their weight (assuming they are roughly human-sized) or another object. At level 6 or higher, the tendril provides an asset on attacks made with it.
Depletion: —

THUNDER CANNON
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Large, heavy tube with a bell-shaped end and a number of controls
Effect: This massive device can barely be held or carried by a single person. When activated, it emits a 50-foot (15 m) wide cone of pure sonic force out to long range. Any creature in that area is knocked prone and stunned for one round, losing its action. Unfixed items the size of a human or smaller are toppled and/or moved at least 5 feet (1.5 m). Larger objects might also be toppled.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

TRANSDIMENSIONAL RAY PROJECTOR
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Handheld device with a number of controls and a wide dish at one end
Effect: This long-range weapon fires a beam of energy that exists on many levels of reality at once. It inflicts damage equal to its level, and it harms creatures that can be affected only by transdimensional effects (such as an abykos). This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

TRIGGER TRAP
Level: 1d6
Form: Small, rather complex box of metal sensor plates, wires, and controls
Effect: A cypher of virtually any kind can be added to this trigger device to turn it into a trap. First, the cypher is added to the device (an Intellect task with a difficulty of 4), and then various wires and plates are affixed permanently to something—a nearby surface, door, hinge, and so on. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people often use straightforward cyphers such as a detonation, a ray emitter, or a similar device. The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)—a door opening, a creature or object moving past the artifact, and so on. The higher the level of the device, the more sophisticated the trigger. For example, a level 4 artifact’s trigger might be based on a creature’s size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a specific type of creature, and a level 6 artifact can trigger based on recognizing an individual creature.
Depletion: Automatic

VUECHI
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: 4-inch (10 cm) silver sphere that hovers in the air
Effect: Once activated, this device follows within 3 feet (1 m) of the user and attacks anyone or anything within immediate range that attacks them. A vuechi attacks with a burst of electricity (up to immediate range) that deals damage equal to the artifact level. Once activated, it functions for 28 hours.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

WEAPON GRAFT
Level: 1d6
Form: Blade, spiked ball, or hammer-like object made of hard, chitinous material or metal, with a sleeve of softer, fleshy material
Effect: This organic graft fits over a hand or empty stump and affixes to the flesh of the host. The physical bond provides an asset to attacks with the grafted weapon. This is a medium weapon that inflicts 4 points of damage (6 points if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
Depletion: —

WINDRIDER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: 8-foot (2.5 m) long metallic wing
Effect: This is a vehicle that can be ridden by someone who makes a difficulty 1 Speed roll each round. In combat, it moves a long distance each round, but on extended trips, it can move up to 80 miles (130 km) per hour, or 100 miles (160 km) per hour if the artifact is level 6 or higher.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100; check on activation but no more than once per day

WINDSLICE BLADE
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Medium-length sword
Effect: This sword is made from a material so durable and dense that the edge is sharper and lasts far longer than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. The blade inflicts 1 additional point of damage (2 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). Its name comes from the idea that it can slice even the wind in half.
Depletion: —

AMULET OF OPERATION
Level: 1d6
Form: A plain metallic disk on a chain
Effect: Once the amulet is keyed to a specific numenera installation, the installation cannot be used by anyone except the amulet’s wearer.
Depletion: —

AUTOMATED BATH
Level: 1d6
Form: A small metal-and-synth hovering sphere that has metallic arms, tubes, and cleaning tools
Effect: This automaton cleans a nearby target on command if the target doesn’t resist. If allowed to finish, over the course of about a minute, the target is cleaned of all dirt and grime, their teeth are cleaned, their hair is washed and brushed, and their nails are trimmed. This also cleans the target’s clothing.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

BORING LANCE
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A long metal-and-glass tube fitted with a metallic device studded with controls
Effect: When pointed at a solid surface within short range and activated, a cavity is immediately bored in the surface but only if the material composing it is less than or equal to the artifact’s level. The cavity is an immediate distance across and up to a short distance deep. If the surface being bored isn’t at least a short distance thick, the lance doesn’t continue into a different kind of material or into open air—it just stops (but it could be activated again to bore through that material).
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

BRAIN FOGGER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Large backpack-sized device with a metallic wand connected with hoses and wires
Effect: When activated, the brain fogger produces a prodigious amount of fog that moves with the prevailing air in a cloud a very long distance across. Attacks attempted by creatures within the fog are hindered. If deployed against a ranked community or horde, the target is treated as if one rank lower than normal during that community action.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

BREATHING FIELD SPINNER
Level: 1d6
Form: A 12-foot (4 m) tall collapsible metal tripod with a large metal globe at the top; the globe has a number of holes in it but is not hollow
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. It then requires an action to activate. When activated, the globe at the top begins to spin, sending out fresh, breathable air in all directions in a continuous wind up to a very long distance across (though current weather or air pressure can shrink that radius) for about an hour. Creatures within the area can breathe normally even if in a toxic atmosphere. Creatures are also protected from effects that move as a mist, fog, or spread of particulates, assuming those particulates can’t move under their own power. If deployed to protect from a ranked airborne threat of some sort, the rank of that threat is decreased by one step.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

CELLULAR ANNEALER
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A small handheld device with a few simple controls
Effect: This device emits a faint, short-range beam that affects only organic creatures and materials. A living target hit by the beam moves up one step on the damage track. A target that is not down on the damage track can immediately make a free recovery roll (or, for NPCs, regain a number of points of health equal to their level × 3).
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

CLOAK OF FINERY
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A multilayered cloak of glittering material
Effect: This cloak is woven of smart fibers and studded with small devices designed to not only automatically tailor the cloak’s fit to its wearer but also highlight the wearer in the most attractive light possible, providing variable illumination, sound amplification, tone control, and even a limited ability to edit grammatical mistakes and pauses made by the wearer. When activated, the cloak provides an asset to all interaction tasks the wearer attempts for the next minute.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

COGNITION TESTER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A head-sized metallic box studded with dials and controls
Effect: Using this device always takes at least two rounds because producing an effect requires that the user solve a newly generated cognitive puzzle by successfully manipulating the device’s controls, rotational planes, and other hidden inputs. Solving the puzzle is an Intellect task with a difficulty equal to the artifact’s level. If successful, the user is injected with the knowledge of a random numenera plan whose level is up to the level of the artifact. If the user fails the cognition test, they suffer 4 points of Intellect damage (but do not trigger a depletion roll).
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

DEAD TIMELINE VIEWER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Metallic device mounted with a 6-inch (15 cm) crystal screen
Effect: Holographic images flicker to life on the screen, showing the user in a situation that has never happened in this reality and that probably never will. With some study and experimentation, the user deduces that the images represent outcomes that would’ve occurred except for some decision the user made in the past that set them on their current course. Once that is understood, the user can attempt to use the device to explore a range of different hypothetical strategies for attempting to deal with a particular issue or problem and see how each might play out. Using the viewer eases the difficulty of a numenera crafting task, a salvage task, a negotiation that takes course over several days, or long-term play rolls that might be required to achieve success.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

EMPTY FIELD GENERATOR
Level: 1d6
Form: : A 12-foot (4 m) tall collapsible metal tripod with a complex antenna array on top and a device with a control surface at the base
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. It then requires an action to activate. When activated, all creatures, structures, and other artificial alterations in the landscape are visually smeared out in a radius equal to a very long distance for one hour. From the outside of the area, nothing is visible except bare ground and innocuous brush. From within the field, creatures can see what’s around them normally, though all illumination drops by one category. This holographic illusion’s level is equal to the artifact’s level.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

ENERGY NULLIFIER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A 15-foot (5 m) tall collapsible tripod with a large directional crystal dish at the top and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. Once set up, it takes an action to activate. The device affects an area a very long distance across that's less than 2 miles (3 km) away and in its direct line of sight. Energy-using devices whose levels are less than or equal to the artifact’s lose power for about one hour. This renders installations, artifacts, and many cyphers unusable for the duration. If deployed against a ranked community or horde that is reliant to even a small degree on artifacts and installations, the target is treated as if one rank lower for one hour.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

EXPLORER’S GLOVES
Level: 1d6
Form: Thick but flexible-fingered gloves with microscopic adaptive hairs on the palms
Effect: The wearer can cling to or climb any surface for up to one hour. Even level 10 climbing tasks become routine while the gloves are activated, but taking any other action while climbing requires a new activation.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

EXPLORER’S LENSES
Level: 1d6
Wearable: Thick lenses built on a device worn on the upper face and eyes
Effect: Informative images formed on the inner lenses help the user to navigate and explore by tracking location, likely trails, and potential openings for one hour. Navigation and perception tasks made while the device is activated gain two assets.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

FEBRIFUGE
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A 12-foot (4 m) tall collapsible metal tripod with a large metal globe at the top; the globe has a number of holes in it but is not hollow
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. It then requires an action to activate. When activated, the globe at the top begins to spin, sending out a spray of pleasant-smelling, calming mist in all directions up to a very long distance for ten hours. The mist doesn't interfere with vision. All tasks and defense rolls by creatures within the area to resist or overcome infectious diseases are eased for the duration. If deployed to protect from a ranked infectious disease, the rank of that disease is decreased by 1.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

FIELD DESTABILIZER
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: A 9-foot (3 m) tall collapsible tripod with a large directional crystal dish at the top and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. Once set up, it takes an action to activate. When activated, this device collapses a force field within short range—or a short-range-diameter portion of a much larger force field—whose level is equal to or less than this artifact’s. A collapsed force field generally remains collapsed for at least 28 hours, if not permanently (but could be reactivated). A field destabilizer can also collapse effects that create illusions or wide-area transdimensional effects within the area.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

FINGENT BRACE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A synth panel screen and wires that must be affixed to the head of a creature using a headband or brace, such that the wearer can glance to the side and see the screen
Effect: This device shows a visual image of the details of a numenera plan, one at a time, provided the user has taken a few days to prep the device. (It can also hold other explicit directions or images, if desired.) If worn during a numenera crafting task for the majority of the time it takes to build an object or structure, the artifact provides one asset to the assessed difficulty of the crafting task.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per month of use)

FLAME SUPPRESSOR
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: A 3-foot (1 m) wide, 6-foot (2 m) long, collapsible metal tube with a set of winding synth tubes wrapped around it
Effect: This device launches a circular device high into the air that hovers overhead for a moment and then seeks out flames within a very long distance. Over the next hour, it draws moisture from the air and quenches any small fires it finds within the area. If deployed to protect against a ranked fire disaster, the fire’s rank is decreased by 2.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

INSTANT REFUGE
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A 2-foot (60 cm) cube with a control surface
Effect: It takes about a minute to activate this device. When activated, it projects a 30- foot (9 m) diameter circular portal on a hard surface within immediate range that leads to an extradimensional space large enough to hold several thousand people in timeless stasis. The portal persists for up to an hour, during which time a small community could be evacuated through the aperture. Once the portal is closed, it can be opened from the outside at any time in the next three months, at which time all those who entered are expelled in the same order that they entered. If three months pass without the portal being opened manually, it opens automatically and expels its occupants. For those inside the portal, no time seems to have passed.
Depletion: 1–2 in 1d6

IOTUM SCANNER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A handheld device with a number of controls and a wide dish at one end
Effect: When activated and pointed at an object within immediate range, this device sounds a tone if the object contains 1 or more units of iotum of any type.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

LIQUID TRANSFER ORB
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: A head-sized amber orb inscribed with tiny metallic lines
Effect: To set up the artifact, the orb is broken into two halves. One half must be submerged in a liquid medium of any kind. Then the other half can be activated for up to 28 hours at a time (though it can be deactivated at any time), during which liquid from the submerged half is instantaneously transferred to the other half across any distance. Up to 150,000 gallons (568,000 l) can be transferred during a one-day activation period. If smartly deployed during a ranked flooding event (so that the output end drains someplace where it won’t just flow back), the rank of the flood is decreased by 2.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROJECTOR
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A 9-foot (3 m) tall collapsible tripod with a complex bundle of interconnected wires on top and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. Once set up, the device sends out a transdimensional pulse that affects all creatures within long range, spreading out their continuity so that they exist on many levels of reality at once for about an hour. Such creatures are treated as phased—they can neither be affected by normal physical phenomena nor affect the normal world of physical matter. If deployed to protect from a ranked threat of some sort (including an attacking horde or community), the rank of that threat is decreased by 1 for the duration.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

MULTI-OPENER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Slender metallic box with several smaller telescoping elements
Effect: When attached to a lock (whether mechanical or machine-mediated) or to the surface of a sealed machine, the multi-opener extends tiny manipulators and attempts to loosen any mechanism holding the device closed or manipulate any lock that is amenable to physical manipulation. Devices fall open like peeled fruits if their level is 1 less than this artifact, and locks open easily if their level is equal to or less than this artifact. Salvage tasks made in conjunction with a multi-opener gain two assets.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

NATALITIAL
Level: 1d6 + 1
Wearable: Helm that projects illusionary images, sounds, and scents
Effect: Wearer can trigger the worn device as an action. On subsequent rounds, lasting for up to an hour, the helm produces a celebratory atmosphere in an area up to a long distance around it, superimposing colorful streamers, hanging lamps, festive music, and potentially additional visual and auditory factors (depending on the specific parameters set by the crafter). If deployed in a ranked community or horde, the rank is increased by 1 for all tasks related to abating sadness and sorrow, to positive interaction, and to the propagation of revelry.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

PACIFYING NEEDLER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A small handheld device with a tiny tube
Effect: This device projects either one or two needles up to long range each time it is used. The needles are far thinner than a human hair, and they inflict no damage. Instead, if one needle is fired, it will calm a belligerent, raging, or attacking creature so that they become calm for at least one minute or until they are attacked. If two needles are fired, the target falls asleep for up to a minute or until they are damaged. The needles can penetrate (ignore) up to 4 Armor. A pacifying needler can be activated to fire all its needles at once on a countdown timer, creating a detonation-like blast that can affect all creatures in line of sight within long range. This depletes and destroys the artifact. If deployed against a ranked horde or community during a conflict in this fashion, the horde or attacking community inflicts 3 less points of damage during that community action.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

PSYCHIC ERADICATOR
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A 15-foot (5 m) tall collapsible tripod with a large directional crystal dish at the top and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. Once set up, it takes an action to activate. When activated, this device can affect an area up to a very long distance across for one hour. Within that area, all tasks relying on psychic effects, such as telepathy and psychokinesis, whose level is equal to or less than the artifact’s are hindered by two steps, and higher-level psychic tasks are hindered by one step. This means that routine tasks like telepathy are no longer routine, and those that require a roll to succeed, such as an Onslaught mindslice, become even more difficult. If deployed within a ranked community or horde, psychic attacks that would inflict damage to the community during one community action are treated as if 1 level lower.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

RUMBLER
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A 9-foot (3 m) tall collapsible metal stand with a large crystalline disc that is partially embedded in the ground at the base and a control box in the center
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. Once set up, it takes an action to activate. When activated, the disk begins to agitate the ground underneath. Everyone and everything within very long range is affected by severe shaking over the next five rounds, building to peak severity on the third round when everyone and everything suffers damage equal to the artifact level and falls prone. Only those within 3 feet (1 m) of the device are unaffected. During all rounds of shaking, tasks that require movement or balance (including attacks) are hindered. This effectively creates a ranked quake event with a rank equal to 4 less than the artifact’s level, which could threaten a ranked community or horde.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

SALVAGE PACK
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Synth pack with attached devices
Effect: This pack’s mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2 m) in diameter. It is larger on the inside than on the outside thanks to transdimensional outpocketing, and it can contain up to 5 tons (4.5 t) worth of material.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack; on depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack)

STABILITY SPIKE
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: A 6-foot (2 m) tall collapsible metal tripod with a central tube that extends a spike into the earth when deployed
Effect: It takes two rounds to assemble and set up this device. Once set up, it requires an action to activate and then another round for the powered internal spike to penetrate the ground. (The spike can penetrate any surface whose level is less than or equal to its own, but it cannot penetrate force fields.) When activated, this device stabilizes the ground and any structures built on the ground within very long range for one hour. This reduces shaking, swaying, or vibration, potentially keeping a tower or buildings caught in an earthquake from collapsing. If deployed to protect from a ranked earthquake or other earth-shaking threat, the rank of that threat is decreased by 1.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

STASIS POD
Level: 1d6
Form: A device attached to a rounded synth chamber just large enough to hold a human
Effect: A person willingly placed inside this chamber remains alive and in perfect stasis until removed.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check every century a subject is in stasis)

STRUCTURAL EXTRUDER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm) long connected to a device that can be carried or worn as a pack
Effect: When activated, it produces a solid piece of amber-colored crystal over the course of a minute that can take one or two simple shapes: a plank up to 10 feet (3 m) long or a plane up to 10 feet (3 m) by 10 feet (3 m) that could be used as a floor, a wall partition, a ramp, etc. If the structural extruder is used as part of the crafting process for building a commonplace or numenera structure, the assessed difficulty for the task is lowered by one step.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check per week of use)

TELEPATHIC WIRE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: A metallic wire on a spindle that can be rolled out to surround an area up to a very long distance in diameter
Effect: It takes several minutes to deploy this device, or longer if trying to place it so it is not obvious. When deployed, all creatures within the area gain the ability to telepathically speak with other creatures they can see within short range for up to an hour. Should the line be broken, all creatures in the area suffer 1 point of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). If deployed to surround a ranked community or horde, the rank of the target increases by 1 for the duration due to an enhanced ability to communicate.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

TEMPORARY WING
Level: 1d6
Form: A body harness with a few controls
Effect: This device instantly releases wide synth wings stretched on either side of a rigid frame that together reach almost a short distance across. The wings allow a wearer to fly in any direction up to a short distance as an action each round, or glide horizontally or downward up to a long distance each round as part of another action. After one hour or upon deactivation, the wings retract.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

TOXIC FOGGER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Large backpack-sized device with a metallic wand connected with hoses and wires
Effect: When activated, the toxic fogger produces a prodigious amount of yellowish fog that lasts an hour and moves with the prevailing air in a cloud a very long distance across. Creatures exposed to the fog for several minutes take damage from poison equal to the artifact’s level. If deployed against a ranked community or horde, 3 points of damage are inflicted to the target’s health during one community action.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

WEARABLE WORKSHOP, BASIC
Level: 1d6 + 1
Usable: Large pack-like device with multiple extending arms and tools
Effect: This mobile workshop allows a crafter to work without a workbench and tools. The mobile workbench holds crafted objects in place and provides additional tools for a variety of needs, including not only crafting tasks but also tasks associated with investigation and analysis. The wearable workshop enables crafting tasks by providing appropriate tools; its extra limbs replicate a work surface. The wearable workshop is bulky, however, and any character wearing one is hindered in all Speed defense tasks.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check per week of use)

WEARABLE WORKSHOP, SMART
Level: 1d6 + 3
Usable: Large pack-like device with multiple extending arms and tools
Effect: As the basic wearable workshop, except the smart workshop has a limited capacity to improve the work of its maker, providing two assets to the assessed difficulty of any crafting task done predominantly while wearing the workshop. The wearable workshop is bulky, however, and any character wearing one is hindered in all Speed defense tasks.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per completed crafting project)

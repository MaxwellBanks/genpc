2,cypher,"\nCyphers\n\nCyphers are single use items that provide powerful effects for players. They are common in the game and should be used often, as holding too many of them at once can cause them to interact in dangerous ways (see the Cypher Danger table).\n\nCyphers have levels that affect their power and three forms: internal, wearable, or usable."
3,artifact,"\nArtifacts\n\nArtifacts are the semipermanent equivalent of cyphers. Generally, artifacts are incomprehensible even to educated characters and are used very differently by players than the original civilization that built them."
4,oddity,"\nOddities\n\nOddities are items left behind by the ancients that have no real in game value. They can be traded, sold, used, or given as gifts, and are generally worth around 10 shins."
5,cydanger,"\nCypher Dangers\n\nCyphers are inherently unstable, and gathering too many of them in the same place without the proper precautions can be a recipe for disaster. Once per day, a character carrying more cyphers than their maximum number must roll on the cypher danger table."
6,effects,"\nMajor and Minor Effects\n\nMajor and minor effects occur on high rolls (19 or 20), and allow the roller to do something outside the normal scope of their action (alternatively, the user can do extra damage in combat)."

2,cypher,"\nCyphers\n\nCyphers are single use items that provide powerful effects for players. They are common in the game and should be used often, as holding too many of them at once can cause them to interact in dangerous ways (see the Cypher Danger table).\n\nCyphers have levels that affect their power and three forms: internal, wearable, or usable."
3,artifact,"\nArtifacts\n\nArtifacts are the semipermanent equivalent of cyphers. Generally, artifacts are incomprehensible even to educated characters and are used very differently by players than the original civilization that built them."
4,oddity,"\nOddities\n\nOddities are items left behind by the ancients that have no real in game value. They can be traded, sold, used, or given as gifts, and are generally worth around 10 shins."
